### Ingredients

- ~250 g puff pastry (store-bought, any kind is fine)

## Filling (custard - banketbakkersroom)

- 3 egg yolks
- 45 g custard powder (pudding powder - crèmepoeder)
- 125 g granulated sugar
- 1 vanilla pod (vanillestok)
- 2 to 3 apples (slightly sour is better)

Note: you can replace the custard powder by an equal amount of corn starch. If
you skipped the vanilla pod, make sure to add other vanilla flavours.

### Directions

- gently whisk 100 ml of milk with the egg yolks
- add custard powder and granulated sugar
- heat 400 ml of milk and the vanilla bean to a boil
- remove from the stove
- temper the custard mixture by gently add a few spoons of the boiling milk and stirring
- gently pour the tempered custard mixture into the milk and slowly bring to a boil
- stir gently but continuously with a spatula
- pour into the cake pan once bubbles are forming
- let cool down
- peel and slice the apples
- arrange them on top of the tart
- pre-heat the oven to 200 °C

- let the tart cool down for a bit on a rack


## Finish

### Ingredients

- 1 bag of Dr. Oetker Taartina
- 200 ml apple juice

### Directions

- mix the Taartina with a few spoons of the apple juice, stir well until dissolved
- heat the applje juice almost to a boil
- remove from the heat and stir in the mixture
- bring back to a boil until bubbles are forming
- pour the mixture evenly over the tart

Or, alternatively, 2 gelatin leaves instead of Taartina:

- soften the gelatin leaves in some water
- heat up a few tablespoons of the apple juice, do not boil
- turn off the heat, add the gelatin leaves
- pour into a container and refrigerate until somewhat thickened (~1.5 hours)
- once you feel confident, pour it evenly over the tart, covering all apples
- refrigerate for 2 hours
