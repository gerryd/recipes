# Advocaat

This recipe does not cook the eggs. However, this advocaat can be kept safely in
the fridge (or even a cupboard) for up to 6 months, as the alcohol will act as a
conservant.

If you do not feel comfortable consuming raw eggs, you can heat up the mixture
after adding the condensed milk (but before adding the alcohol). It should reach
a temperature of 70 °C.

## Ingredients

- 8 large or 10 small eggs (more is better)
- 200 cl 96% alcohol
- 300 gr very fine granulated sugar
- 20 gr vannilated sugar (or vanilla flavour)
- 385 ml (1 can) condensed milk (unsweetened)

## Directions

- separate the white and yolks
- mix the yolks with the sugar until it is dissolved
- add in the vannilated sugar
- slowly add the condensed milk, keep mixing
- slowly add the alcohol, keep mixing
- pour into a jar or bottle, refrigerate for 12 hours
